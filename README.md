# Social_Network_API
A NoSQL backend for a mock social network. Created by John Medeiros on July 13, 2022.

This is a restful API with connection to a Mongo database for the backend. It simulates a social media website, where users can be created, users can add friends and thoughts, and anyone can react to another user's thoughts.

To run the application make sure you run NPM install in the proper directory, and then NPM start to start it up. Currently there is no data to seed but that is a planned feature for future development.
